Cases of laryngeal cancer are increasing, and currently, doctors often use invasive biopsy procedures to diagnose it. But there's a different idea: we can use voice recordings to find patients at high risk for the disease. This would help doctors focus on those who need urgent attention.

We came up with a way to test how well a computer program can understand speech when there's background noise. We did experiments using this method with different computer programs and noise reduction techniques. The best computer program was the random forest classifier, which was accurate 81.2% of the time when the speech was clear. But when there was noise, the accuracy dropped to 63.8%. All the programs had lower accuracy with noise, and while noise reduction helped, it didn't completely fix the problem.

Dealing with noise in speech recognition is tricky, and we need to solve this issue before these systems can be used in real medical practice. We showed that our method lets us test how well these computer programs work with noise.
