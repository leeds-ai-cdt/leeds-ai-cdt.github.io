title: Assessing Domain Adaptation Techniques for Mitosis Detection in Multi-scanner Breast Cancer Histopathology Images â€“ Jack Breen 2022
tags:
- Conference_Publication
---

This study focused on assessing domain adaptation techniques to adjust the style of histopathology images to appear as though they had been created using different slide scanners as part of the MIDOG Challenge at MICCAI 2021. This is important because there are clear differences between images from different scanners which lead to poor generalisation in AI models.
