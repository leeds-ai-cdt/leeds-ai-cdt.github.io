In AI^2 the June 2023 edition Zoe and Jason hosted a testathon session where together we explored Pytesting of AI models to improve our code reliability, reduce bugs and increase our error finding efficiency.

If you'd like to find out more about Pytesting, you can access our interactive notebook [here](https://github.com/ZoeHancox/ML_pytesting_tutorial).

In the second half of the session we improved our elevator pitches. From sharing our deepest darkest ‘crocodile wrestling’ secrets to selling ourselves for our skills, we learnt what we shouldn’t say if we don’t want our potential employer to hop out of the lift on the next floor. We particularly liked Lewis Howell and Alex Coles’ answer to `where do you see yourself going?` as `wherever the data takes me`.
