Mary presented at the February edition of [Cafe Scientifique](http://cafesci.hdtleeds.org.uk/). She presented on the use of AI to detect diseases from speech in a presentation titled "Dr Alexa: detecting disease from your voice". We discussed the detection of throat cancer and dementia and the challeneges that rise from using AI in healthcare. It was great to discuss this work with a diverse audience and see hear how the public views the possible use of AI in the future of healthcare.
