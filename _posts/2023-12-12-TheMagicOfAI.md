Three of our students ran an AI workshop for classes of year 7, 8, and 9 students. In this workshop we explained how decision trees can be made and challenged the students to make some of their own. We then showed the students some decision trees in action when we got an AI to guess their age from the sound of their voice. We also discussed how object detection works and how it can be used (for example self driving cars). We showed an example of live object detection and the students tried different objects to see if the detector could recognise them. We were featured on the school blog [here](https://www.titussaltschool.co.uk/ai-adventures/?from=239)!
