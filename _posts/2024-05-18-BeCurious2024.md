For the third year running, we showed off some of our work at [Be Curious](https://www.leeds.ac.uk/becurious). Throughout the day, we got to show many different families some of the work we are doing with sound. We demonstrated how sound was produced at different pitches (with the help of some boom whackers!), explained how computers use decision trees to separate groups and showed off how clever our computer is at guessing the ages of the people visiting just from their voice! We had a great day meeting so many new people and talking about the work we do at the University.
