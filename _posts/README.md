Two of our students attended the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) in New Orleans. Mary presented a poster in the [Women in Machine Learning workshop](https://wimlworkshop.org/2022-wiml-workshop/) summarising her work using AI to detect voice disease from speech. Bailey presented a preprint of his work at the [New Frontiers in Graph Learning](https://glfrontiers.github.io/) workshop. This conference was an amazing opportunity to meet a wide range of researchers and see the newest cutting edge work being done in computer science.
