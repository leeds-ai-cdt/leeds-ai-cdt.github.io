On April 10th the LIDA Health Early Career Researcher (ECR) community held their first event. This was the first of 5 events aiming to empower ECRs with skills to identify knowledge gaps, write project proposals, advance career trajectories, foster collaborations, and expand networks.

At this event participants were given the opportunity to introduce themselves. Associate Professor Sam Relton spoke about his experiences after recently being involved in a NIHR grant panel and we were walked through the different options for fellowships and funding.

Participants had a chance to discuss areas of interest in round tables and form groups for the grant writing competition taking place on July 10th.

The following events will be on the 22nd May, 5th June, 10th July, and 24th July.
