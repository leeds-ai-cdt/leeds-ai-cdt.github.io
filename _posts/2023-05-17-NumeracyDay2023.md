We were very excited to be invited to take part in [National Numeracy Day](https://www.nationalnumeracy.org.uk/numeracyday) at the University of Leeds. We had the opportunity to explain the role that numeracy has in our jobs to groups of students from local secondary schools. Each student was encouraged to write down what they had learned about our jobs after speaking to us and some of what they said can be seen in the pictures below.
