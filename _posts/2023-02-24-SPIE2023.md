This week, three of our PGRs had their first experience discussing their research at an international conference! This included presentations about [efficiency in ovarian cancer classification using histopathology data](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/12471/1247110/Efficient-subtyping-of-ovarian-cancer-histopathology-whole-slide-images-using/10.1117/12.2653869.short?SSO=1), [explainability in the classification of chest x-rays](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/12464/1246411/Learning-disentangled-representations-for-explainable-chest-x-ray-classification-using/10.1117/12.2654345.short), and a poster about the [effective compression of histopathology data](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/12471/124711B/Digital-pathology-whole-slide-image-compression-with-vector-quantized-variational/10.1117/12.2647844.short). The San Diego conference was a fantastic opportunity to connect with other researchers, discuss new ideas, and learn more about the wider field of AI in medical imaging.
