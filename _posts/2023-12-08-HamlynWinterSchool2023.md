One of our students attended the Hamlyn Winter School on Surgical Imaging and Vision at Imperial College London, hosted by the Hamlyn Centre. The week-long course featured technical and clinical talks as well as small lectures and workshops from industry (NVIDIA and MedTronic). In addition to lectures covering state of the art in surgical imaging, robot-assisted imaging and vision algorithms for tracking, scene reconstruction and navigation, the Hamlyn Centre provided participants the opportunity to collect their own data with a variety of surgical robots including the da Vinci surgical system. The week culminated with group presentations of small projects completed over the week.
