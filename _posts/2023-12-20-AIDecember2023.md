On the 20th of December 2023, the AI^2 forum hosted its second Christmas bake-off! This year, we had a range of exciting entries, from delicious Snow DAG chocolate fudge cakes and Random Forest Brownies to melted Snowpeople Cookies and Gingerbread AI^2 Cookies. Everyone enjoyed having a nibble on a sweet treat or three; the entries were amazing, and judging these bakes was immensely rewarding for our tummies!

The winner of this year’s bake-off was Lewis Howell with his tasty Christmas Random Forest Brownies! The results of the poll can be seen in the pictures below.

This year, we worked with [Leeds Hospitals Charity](https://www.leedshospitalscharity.org.uk/Listing/Category/the-difference-we-make) and asked people to donate money for these fabulous bakes. Together, we managed to raise over £260.88 in online donations alone (money from the collection tin count pending)!

We look forward to next year's bake-off. Thanks to everyone who participated and donated.
