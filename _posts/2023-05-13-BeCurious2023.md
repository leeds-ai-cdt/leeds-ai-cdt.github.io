This year we got the opportunity to show off some of our work at [Be Curious](https://www.leeds.ac.uk/becurious). This is an event run by the university which gives the opportunity for researchers to present their work to families. We hosted three different stalls all about the exciting work we do in medical AI. The first stall was all out how wearable sensors can be used to monitor patient health. The second stall allowed families to see how ultrasound could be used in diagnosis and have a go using a model of the throat. The third stall pitted families against an AI in guessing someone's age based only on their speech. We had a brilliant time showing off our research to the next generation of researchers!
