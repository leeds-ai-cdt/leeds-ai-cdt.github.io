We had an AI-themed Christmas bakeoff and medical quiz to end the year. 10 bakers took part in the bakeoff.

Among the entries were a vegan-friendly cake concocted by #GPT3 (baker: Sam Llanwarne); a motherboard sponge, complete with 12th Generation Intel processor (baker: Sobia Khan) and an edible artificial neural network to predict whether children would enjoy their crimbo gifts (baker: Zoe Hancox).
Congratulations to our winning baker, Sobia, for her delicious and wonderfully presented motherboard sponge. Congratulations also to Si√¢n Carey, Mary Paterson and Emma for their comfortable win in one of the toughest quizzes I have seen, created by our resident medic, Allan Pang.
