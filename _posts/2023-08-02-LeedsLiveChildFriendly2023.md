At the [Child Friendly Leeds Live festival](https://www.breezeleeds.org/cfl-live/), PhD students, including Victoria Moglia, Morgan Thomas, 
Oliver Umney, Xin Ci Wong, Zoe Hancox, and Oliver Mills, enthusiastically contributed to the [BeCurious](https://www.leeds.ac.uk/becurious) initiative. Their collective 
effort centered around running an engaging stall aimed at sparking children's curiosity about the realm of artificial intelligence and its applications in healthcare.

Throughout the event, children were encouraged to envision and illustrate their concepts of a "robot doctor," igniting imaginative discussions on the prospect of 
entrusting their care to such mechanical caregivers. Additionally, the team facilitated insightful conversations on the potential merits of having a robot doctor 
attend to them when feeling unwell.

Beyond these creative interactions, the group introduced the youngsters to the concept of decision trees. 
Through relatable examples, the children learned how computer algorithms could grasp the nuances of categorising animals like cats and dogs based on characteristics 
as diverse as tail length, ear shape, and even preferred snacks.
