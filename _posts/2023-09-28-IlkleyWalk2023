As part of our induction week into the MDT, and to give a chance for those from outside God's Own Count[r]y to get to see a bit of the area, the cohort 5 people took the train out to Ilkley, and had a walk up onto Ilkley Moor (most of us without hats, but we survived). The weather was a good representation of that of Yorkshire in general: starting grey and getting wetter... But the pub at the end was lovely and warm!
