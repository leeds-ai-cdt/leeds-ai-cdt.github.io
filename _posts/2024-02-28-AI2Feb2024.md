This month, we had a fantastic guest speaker, Declan Baldwin from Aire Logic. Declan is a senior software engineer with around 8 years of software engineering experience.

Declan spoke about two projects currently being undertaken:

* Tremorscope - which aims to measure tremors in Parkinson's patients and provide an objective measurement, compared to subjective and varied measurements among clinicians. An app is being developed to measure UPDRS rating, amplitude, and frequency of hand tremors using hand tracking and LIDAR camera depth tracking.

* Lifelight - aiming to measure vital signs without needing specialist equipment. In the UK, 43% of people are undiagnosed with hypertension due to the lack of readily available means to measure blood pressure. With Lifelight, a person's blood pressure, oxygen level, and pulse rate can be determined just by using a video of their face. This project works by observing color changes around the face in regions of interest that are not perceptible to the human eye.

Declan inspired the audience and fielded an array of interesting questions, ranging from software pipelines to stakeholder needs.

In the second half of the session, we worked in teams to innovate and regulate projects, including endeavors such as chatbots for anxiety and satellite monitoring for flooding. Groups gave pitches, sharing the need for innovations and how they would address regulation issues, including privacy concerns, data security, and ethical data sourcing.
