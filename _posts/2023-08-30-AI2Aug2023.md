# Demystifying the PhD Viva

Are you gearing up for your PhD viva and feeling a mix of excitement and apprehension? You're not alone! The PhD viva, or viva voce examination, is a significant milestone in your doctoral journey. 
To help ease your concerns and provide valuable insights, the recent AI^2 Forum session on August 30th was dedicated to "Demystifying the PhD Viva." 

At the heart of the AI^2 Forum session was Professor David Hogg, who gave us an enlightening overview of what the PhD viva process entails at the University of Leeds. His extensive experience in the 
realm of vivas paved the way for a comprehensive understanding of what to expect.

To shed more light on this crucial phase of doctoral studies, we had the privilege of hosting a diverse panel of experts for our question and answer session:

1. **Professor Vania Dimitrova**: A professor of human-centred AI with an impressive record of examining approximately 20 theses, spanning multiple countries.

2. **Associate Professor Marc de Kamps**: Hailing from the School of Computing, Marc de Kamps brought his expertise from approximately 10 viva examinations.

3. **Associate Professor Sam Relton**: With 3 viva examinations under his belt, Sam Relton provided valuable insights, especially for those who might be curious about the experience of someone who did their viva 6 years ago.

4. **Professor David Hogg**: Known for examining so many vivas that he's lost count, Professor Hogg's wealth of experience was an invaluable asset to our discussion.

The AI^2 Forum session witnessed a fantastic turnout this month and thank you all for your contributions!
