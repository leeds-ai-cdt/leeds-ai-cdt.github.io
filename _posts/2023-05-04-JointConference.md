This year we hosted the AI CDTs in Healthcare Conference in York. Students from each of the four CDTs presented their research both with oral presentations and posters. We also had two excellent keynotes speakers - Dorothy Monekosso presented "Why is innovating in digital health challenging?" and Richard Stephens presented "Fleshing Out The Data â€“ Involving Patients In Your Research". It was a great opportunity to meet with other students doing work in this field to discuss ideas and challenges while working in this area.
