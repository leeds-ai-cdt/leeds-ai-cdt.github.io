This year we met with three other CDTs doing work in AI for medicine in York. Students from each CDT presented their work both with oral presentations and posters. We also had two excellent keynotes speakers. Dorothy Monekosso presented Why is innovating in digital health challenging? and Richard Stephens presented Fleshing Out The Data â€“ Involving Patients In Your Research. It was a great opportunity to meet with other students doing work in this field to discuss ideas and challenges while working in this area.
