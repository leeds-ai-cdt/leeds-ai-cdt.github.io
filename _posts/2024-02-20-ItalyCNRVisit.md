I was recently given the opportunity to visit the "Instituto per le Applicazioni del Calcolo" (IAC)
at the National Research Council of Italy (CNR), with my supervisor Luisa Cutillo.

# Objectives
1) See if the methodology we developed could successfully be applied to data produced there
2) Build connections with researchers at another institute
3) Kick off some collaborations

# Results
On all accounts, the visit was a success!  I left Italy with a renewed confidence in our methodology, with two ongoing collaborations,
and some new friends ðŸ˜Ž.  Also, I had some time to be a tourist.
