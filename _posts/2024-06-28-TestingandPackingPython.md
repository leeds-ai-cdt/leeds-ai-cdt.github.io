On Friday June 28th 2024, [SciML](https://sciml-leeds.github.io/) hosted a workshop with Zoe Hancox teaching participants how to Test and Package your code. In this session participants learnt about how to test Python code, how to use Pytest, what make a good GitHub repository, what code packaging is, and how to package with PyPI.

Do want to learn the basics of testing code and how to package your code, but missed the 'Testing and Packaging your Python Code' workshop? Fear not! You can find the repository containing instructions and the corresponding slides here: [Pytesting and PyPI Tutorial](https://github.com/ZoeHancox/pytesting_and_pypi_tutorial).
