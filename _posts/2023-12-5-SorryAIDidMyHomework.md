As part of Bradford Tech Fest, our students ran a number of workshops in schools about the use of generative AI. These sessions, delivered to pupils between the age of 15 and 18, covered how the pros and cons of tools such as ChatGPT, as well as an overview of how image diffusion models work (and where they go wrong!). The sessions rounded up with a lively debate where the students were asked to consider what would do if they were a headteacher of a school forming a policy on the use of AI tools. Should students be allowed to utilise these tools? The verdict – it’s complicated!
