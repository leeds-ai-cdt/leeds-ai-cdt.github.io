Despite treatment, patients’ cancer can get worse. Knowing when patients’ cancer got worse allows researchers to assess and improve cancer treatment. Right now, trained medical staff must look through patients’ records to find this information. This prevents them from doing other important duties, costing the health care service time and money.

I research how machine learning can enable computers to automatically determine the time when patients’ cancer worsened. This project aims to the save the healthcare services time, money, and help doctors improve treatments more quickly.
