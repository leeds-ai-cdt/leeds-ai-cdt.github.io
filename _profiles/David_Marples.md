This is a "proof of principle" plain text explanation!

Hospital A&E units are sometimes really busy, and sometimes not. If we can tell when it gets busy, we can use staff and resources well. My study will try to find what causes high or low numbers. This means doctors can be there when needed, and you wonâ€™t need to wait so long.</br></br>
Some things that might matter are the weather, and what else is on in Leeds. Any disease you already have is likely to be important, too, especially if you have a disease like cancer. We will get data on lots of these things, and work out which ones are useful in telling us the number of people coming on a given day. That way, the managers can make sure there is space and staff for emergencies. We also want to avoid wasting staff who could otherwise be doing planned care.
