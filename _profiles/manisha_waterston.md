Iâ€™m improving treatment for patients who have cancer, and are being treated with a certain type of ultrasound. This involves the same type of technology as baby scanning but at a higher pitch. This allows the beam to heat up the cancer and kill it. The planning for this type of treatment is really difficult and takes a long time. Therefore, I want to use AI to help plan better treatment. 

The kind of AI I use is called reinforcement learning. This AI is effectively a video game such as snake, where the aim of the game is the snake to eat the gem. The AI learns to play the game by being the snake and choosing different actions. These actions give it rewards, by receiving different rewards it learns how to win the game. I will apply the same idea to my AI. My AI will learn the best way to plan the treatment by receiving rewards and improving each time until it finds the best way to plan treatment.
