Society is unfair. Women are less likely to be given pain relief in hospital, less likely to be diagnosed and more likely to not be believed. When AI is used it can take these problems and make them worse. But it doesn’t have to!
I am testing AI to check if it is being unfair, and creating new ways to check if it is being unfair. People need to be able to trust the AI before it can be used. Testing the AI to make sure it is not unfair is one important step in helping people trust it.
