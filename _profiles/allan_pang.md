Vital signs like heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen levels are important for monitoring patients in hospital. These are used in scoring systems to predict when a patient might be at risk of dying. However, current systems donâ€™t consider how these signs change over time, which means they often trigger alerts after a patient has already significantly deteriorated.  We have used AI to detect patterns in these vital sign trends using NHS hospital data. We also found that the hospital a model is trained on can affect how it makes predictions. Overall, these AI models were better at spotting patients who were likely to die, and they did so earlier than current early warning systems.
