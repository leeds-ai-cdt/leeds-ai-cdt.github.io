I am a second-year PhD student, and my project is investigating knee osteoarthritis. Knee osteoarthritis is a common problem where your knee becomes stiff and painful, stopping people being able to do daily tasks such as climbing stairs. No one really knows what causes it, and there are no good treatments. Predicting who might develop osteoarthritis in the future would let us step in and prevent the disease before it causes pain.

My project looks at the menisci, two C-shaped structures in the knee that help keep the knee joint stable. We want to find out if we can predict whether someone will develop osteoarthritis by looking at the menisci.
