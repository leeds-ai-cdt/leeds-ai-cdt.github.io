Abdominal surgery is the most common treatment for many types of abdominal cancers. After abdominal surgery, very few patients die but a large number have poor outcomes like infections. As a result, many patients need to return to hospital after being sent home.

We want to try and identify those patients who are most likely to suffer from poor outcomes. Currently, patients attend a clinic before surgery where they complete maximal exercise tests. However, this method is not appropriate for everyone as not all are able to exercise at a high intensity. We want to investigate whether exercise tests can be replaced with wearable sensors. We provide patients with a sensor to wear at home for 3 days whilst they undergo normal daily activities. Using the data collected from the sensors, we try to predict who is at highest risk of poor outcomes after surgery.
