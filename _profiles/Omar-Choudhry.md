# Surgical Skill Improvements Using AI-Driven Improvements in Low-Resource Settings

My project looks at using AI to train surgeons. The problem is that in poorer countries, surgeons are trained slowly because they don't have enough equipment or expert trainers. This means that these surgeons are forced to perform surgery with more complications, which is more dangerous for patients. The goal is that if we can give them feedback using AI on how to improve their skills with surgical tools, they will become better at performing surgery more quickly. We will do this by using a mobile phone to record a surgeon while they practice surgery and tell them what things they are doing well and what things they could do better. Hopefully, this will help us train more surgeons to save more lives, especially in these poorer countries, which need more surgeons.
