## About me

I am a PhD student working on focussed ultrasound for treating thyroid nodules. My research is on AI and ultrasound imaging, aiming to make focused ultrsaound treatment faster, safer and more effective. Before moving to Leeds I studied for a Master's degree in Natural Sciences at the University of Exeter.

## Research title

AI-integrated treatment planning and real-time guidance for Ultrasound Guided High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (USgHIFU) ablation of thyroid nodules

## Simple title

Using AI and focused ultrasound to treat thyroid nodules  

## Plain English Summary
Your thyroid is an important organ in your neck, which is found at the base of the neck, just below the Adamâ€™s apple. Thyroid nodules are lumps that form in the thyroid. Most thyroid nodules aren't serious and don't cause symptoms. Some thyroid nodules, however, may become large enough to be visible or make it difficult to swallow or breathe. 

The doctor may send you for surgery, or suggest to waiting to see if the nodule shrinks on its own. Another option is focused ultrasound, which is a new treatment that uses ultrasound energy. It works by focusing ultrasound energy through your skin and onto the nodule, allowing it to destroy the thyroid nodule without cutting your skin. Focused ultrasound is safer than radiotherapy and has fewer side effects than surgery. This means patients treated with focused ultrasound have a faster recovery. 

Our research uses AI to make focused ultrasound easier to use at the bedside. We use ultrasound images and robotics to make the treatment faster and more accurate. This will allow focused ultrasound to be made available to more patients in the future.
