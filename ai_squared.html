  <p><b>What is AI<sup>2</sup>?</b></p>
  
  <p> The Applications and Implications of Artificial Intelligence (AI<sup>2</sup>) forum aims to bring students and researchers together to talk about different areas of AI and data science. We use it allow likeminded researchers to network, give people the opportunity to deepen their knowledge and share ideas.  We also hold sessions with representatives from industry, where these representatives speak about their career pathway, the company they work at and any work they are undertaking that uses AI. </p>
  <p><b>When does the forum take place?</b></p>
  <p>We hold this forum on the last Wednesday of every month from 4-6pm.</p>
  <p><b>Where is the forum held?</b><p>
  <p>The location varies month to month depending on room availability. The sessions are normally hybrid so you can join in person on campus or you can join online via Teams. Though to get the most out of the networking events we recommend coming in person if you can. We normally provide free food too!</p>
